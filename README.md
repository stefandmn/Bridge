# Bridge

**Bridge** is in fact a _Homebridge_ plugin aiming to control services and attached accessories
to a **Clue** appliance (RPi device) from Home Assistant with Siri and HomeKit. Set it up and poof,
all of your supported accessories will be instantly controllable via Siri. **Bridge** service is fully
integrated in **Clue OS** having builtin options to publish MCPi and PiCam services (and attached camera
devices) and latest _CEC_ devices found on _HDMI_ chain.
Additionally **Bridge** interface has been integrated with **Setup**, allowing to control the most
important functions directly from system setup utility.
